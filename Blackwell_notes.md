# Notes

- In the "Phocion" section, don't re-introduce "Live of E.C.s".

- "Profound… Greece". Rewrite in a more straightforward way. Something like "Wealth and prestige followed…".

- Generally go through and try to remove 9/10ths of all adjectives.

- "Indubitably" find an alternative.

- When you find yourself using the word "nature", think real hard.

- "…we could all learn…" Maybe more the "bigger picture" stuff to the end.
