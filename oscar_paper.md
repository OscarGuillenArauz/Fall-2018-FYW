# Phocion: Life of an Eminent Commander (402 B.C.E. - 317 B.C.E.)

# Introduction

The following paper will serve as an analysis to the essay entitled *PHOCION*, the nineteenth essay found within Cornelius Nepos' *Lives of Eminent Commanders*. This collection of essays was written and published sometime during the late first century B.C.E. to the first century A.C.E. The version of the text that I worked with was translated by Rev. John Selby Watson in 1876.[^Watson] The text of Watson's translation was published on the Worldwide Web in 2003.[^Online] I am publishing this digital edition under an open license, with documentation.

# Cornelius Nepos

Cornelius Nepos (110 B.C.E. to 25 B.C.E) was a Roman biographer who, to this day, surmises a highly critical role in all ancient biography, not exclusively Roman biography. Nepos was a close acquaintance of other notable figures, namely Catullus, Cicero and Atticus. He is known to have influenced powerful politicians, the common citizen, and his personal friends, and he wrote about all of it. His works included the *Chronica* (a universal history), geography, poetry, and biographies detailing the lives of Romans and non-Romans.[^Titchener] You may have heard of Nepos through his notable work entitled *Lives of Eminent Commanders*, for which he is quoted as "perhaps trying to make the great men of history accessible to a wider Roman audience," (233).[^Hornblower] Truly, his works have reached scholars and citizens alike across the entire globe having been translated to English, German, Spanish and numerous other languages. Nonetheless, in his work *Lives of Eminent Commanders*, the commander I was most interested in further researching was Phocion.

During the years between the late first century B.C.E. to the first century A.C.E., Roman biographer Cornelius Nepos sought out to do the uncommon- he took on the profession of a scribe and determined to write about the lives of well-known, eminent commanders during and around his time. Known to be his only surviving work to date, he finalized his collection of essays under the name *Lives of Eminent Commanders*. One of those so-called "Eminent Commanders" was known as Phocion.

# Phocion: Life of an Eminent Commander (402 B.C.E. - 317 B.C.E.)

## Phocion the Good -  The Recollection of Nepos

Born in the year 402 B.C.E. in Athens, Greece, Phocion would soon become a widely recognized Athenian military general and earned the appellation "The Good" as a result of his seemingly "incorruptible moral integrity."[^Phocion] In fact, Phocion's life was so significant during this era that two of the most notable biography scribes during that time- named Nepos and Plutarch- both wrote about him in their works *Lives of Eminent Commanders* and *Plutarch's Lives*, respectively.

In ancient Greece, wealth and prestige followed profound military intellect and formidable leadership. Nepos suggests that there is always an exception to the rule, and Phocion is that exception. Nepos described him as "often at the head of armies" and holding "the most important commands."[^Hornblower] Without a doubt, his recognition must have some sort of prosperity in association with it, whether it be monetary or otherwise materialistic. Is that not the case with Phocion?

Nepos continues.

"...he was surnamed The Good. He was always poor, though he might have been extremely rich, by reason of the numerous offices conferred upon him, and the high commissions given to him by the people."[^Hornblower] Further, Nepos recollects the event during which King Philip presented Phocion with a, quote, "large sum of money," which, of course, he refused to accept. The King's ambassadors went so far as to pressure Phocion into accepting the pecuniary gift by referring to the poverty his children were suffering through.[^Hornblower] "Have some regard for [your] children, for whom it would be difficult, in the depth of poverty, to act up on the high character of their father."[^Hornblower]

Phocion responds without hesitation.

"If my children be like me, this same little farm, which has enabled me to reach my present eminence, will maintain them; but if they prove unlike me, I should not wish their luxury to be supported and increased at my expense."[^Hornblower] He responds by saying that if his children really were to be his own, they too will become successful living on this "little farm" where he too was has lived and managed to reach the pinnacle of Athenian society. His mentality is as follows: If my children cannot walk the same footsteps as I, then they do not deserve to leach off of my well-earned luxury. They must earn their luxury on their own. He seeks to continue and pass on his mentality of Goodness to his children using a very lassies-faire-like manner. He may not be able to change the mentality of those around him in his society, but he can make a difference in the lives of his descendants.

## The *Strategos* - The Recollection of Plutarch

Written by Plutarch in 75 A.C.E., and likely a work derived from Nepos' own, *Plutarch's Lives* exemplifies Phocion's militaristic intellect and how it came to be. Under the guidance of then (and still) well-known philosopher Plato and having pursued "the noblest studies and practices", Phocion forged a sophisticated intelligence which granted him a "tendency to take a broad and impartial view[s] of political and military situations."[^Phocion]

Yearning to learn more about his world, Phocion, in 351 B.C.E., ventured from Athens, enlisting himself into the Persian military, quickly rising to the Persian military leadership within 2 years. His quick rise to fame was unprecedented, and it was further fortified in his close relationship with Artaxerxes III and helping him "put down a rebellion in Cyprus."[^Phocion] Returning to Athens, he "immediately became one of the leading voices in the Assembly," and was elected *strategos* (the general of his tribe) an astounding 45 times (45 years) without ever campaigning for office.[^Phocion]

# Conclusion
The pictures of Phocion by the two noteworthy biographers share differences worth mentioning. Nepos merely alludes to Phocion's successes a military leader and focuses much more on his reputation as "The Good." Plutarch, on the other hand, hardly wrote about his noteworthiness as The Good but placed heavy emphasis on the militaristic aspects of his lifetime and further built on the foundation built by Nepos.

He was revered for his ability to be humble. He did not let the materialistic define who he was. Perhaps he was trying to convey a message through his actions about just how much wealth places a label on someone's life, but it is clear that Phocion was more than likely attempting to teach through his actions and we could all learn from his message, especially now in the 21st Century. He truly was Good in a time where corruption was commonplace in the Athenian political class.[^Phocion]

Phocion exemplified the model character of the Athenian political elite. 'Actions speak louder than words' is the quote that continuously comes to mind when reading about Phocion's life. I believe we all have something to learn and adopt from his character. We should strive to be intelligent and thoughtful, as well as humble and fortuitous leaders when need be. Whether we choose to or not completely depends on us, but one fact is certain - if we choose to do so, it will be something good.
